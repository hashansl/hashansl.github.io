      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a student of Statistics and Data Science, I used to overlook certain topics in Data Structures and Algorithms. To be honest, I never really needed them in my research work, so I let myself believe they weren’t relevant. But as I started taking on different kinds of projects, especially ones involving coding challenges and system design, I realized I was missing something important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the concepts I struggled with the most was &lt;strong&gt;recursion&lt;/strong&gt;. It felt confusing and even a bit intimidating. I would look at recursive code and wonder, &lt;em&gt;Where does it end? How does it even work?&lt;/em&gt; So, I ignored it until I couldn’t anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
