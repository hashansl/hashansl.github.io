      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, I have been steadily working and growing in the field of data science! navigating its steep learning curves, celebrating small breakthroughs, and wrestling with the occasional late-night bug that just wouldn’t go away. But it wasn’t until a recent conversation with a Senior Data Scientist at Apple that something clicked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During our mentoring session, he casually mentioned that he is been keeping a blog to document his journey, sharing insights, reflecting on lessons learned, and even using it to connect with others in the field. That simple idea stuck with me. It felt like a nudge I didn’t know I needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
