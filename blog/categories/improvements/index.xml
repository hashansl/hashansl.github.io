      <description>&lt;p&gt;One special thing about myself is I really like to code. I would spend countless hours to solve a problem. When I am coding, time goes really fast!. It is mainly because I really enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I hate writing. It is not my first language. When I was a kid, I had really-bad grades for English. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know grammar, and I struggle a lot! When time goes by, I improved my English. I knew some amount of grammar, and I could write something, but it was never perfect!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
